                Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”): An inter-governmental body that focuses exclusively on combatting
                money laundering
                and funding terrorism. FATF is essentially a policy-making and standard setting body that promotes
                policies to combat

                money laundering or

                <strong>
                    7. CUSTOMER DUE DILIGENCE / KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER (CDD / KYC)
                </strong>
                In terms of its obligations at law, CryptoSafe is obliged to determine the applying to register on the
                Company's website
                for the purpose of receiving services, or any beneficial owner, and to verify that such person is the
                person he purports
                to be, as well as to determine whether such person is acting on behalf of someone else, and to establish
                the purpose and
                intended nature of the business relationship and to monitor this relationship on an ongoing basis. In
                order to
                successfully adhere to its obligations, CryptoSafe has developed Customer Due Diligence (“CDD”) measures
                which must be
                implemented by CryptoSafe and adhered to by its management and employees. <br><br>

                The CDD measures assist CryptoSafe in determining whether a particular Customer falls within their risk
                appetite, as
                well as helps the Company clearly understand the business activities of the Customer in such a way that
                any transactions
                which fall outside the business profile of the company may be investigated to determine whether any
                money laundering or
                funding of terrorism may be involved. This enables the Company management and Compliance Officer to
                inform relevant
                authorities, in particular the NCA, in a timely manner with adequate information on its Customer and
                their activities
                when such a request is made.<br><br>

                In summary, CryptoSafe has adopted its Due Diligence policies in order to successfully carry out the
                following:<br><br>

                1. Identification and verification of the identity of the applicant, who completes the appropriate
                application form on
                the website in order to register on the company's portal for services;<br>
                2. Identification and verification of the beneficial owner, where applicable;<br>
                3. Obtaining information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship;<br>
                4. Conducting ongoing monitoring of the business relationship;<br>
                5. Establishing the source of wealth and source of funds;<br>
                6. Setting up of a Customer acceptance policy and ensuring that the applicant is compliant with the
                services outlined in
                such policy and on the website;<br>
                7. CryptoSafe is strictly prohibited from keeping anonymous accounts or accounts in fictitious
                names.<br>
                8. CryptoSafe is obliged to collect necessary identification information about each Customer with which
                a new business
                relationship is established.<br>

                    9. MONITORING AND REPORTING
                </strong>
                Monitoring customers is essential to ensure effective application of CryptoSafe AML / CFT policies,
                procedures, internal
                controls, and automated systems.<br><br>

                All employees must satisfy any legal obligation to report knowledge or suspicions relating to the
                proceeds of unlawful
                activities or money laundering in the required format and within the time frames required by
                FCA.<br><br>

                Any employee who knows or ought reasonably to have known or suspected that:
                • CryptoSafe has received or is about to receive the proceeds of unlawful activities or property that is
                connected to an
                offence relating to the financing of terrorist and related activities;<br>
                • a transaction, to which CryptoSafe is party, facilitated the transfer of the proceeds of unlawful
                activities or
                property connected to an offence relating to the financing of terrorist and related activities; or <br>
                • CryptoSafe has been used in any way for money laundering purposes or to facilitate the commission of
                an offence
                relating to the financing of terrorist and related activities -
                must immediately notify the Compliance Officer if he / she suspects or has any reason to suspect that
                any potentially
                suspicious activity has occurred or is about to occur. <br><br>

                The Compliance Officer, upon investigating and being fully satisfied that the transaction or activity is
                suspicious, or
                Company`s employee, if he/she is aware of any suspicious transaction, shall notify the NCA of this
                suspicious activity
                or transaction which indicates possible money laundering or terrorism financing. The notification shall
                be made as soon
                as is practicable compiling a SAR report and uploading it to the secure SAR Portal. It negates the need
                for paper-based
                reporting, provides an instant acknowledgement and reference number (reports submitted manually do not
                receive an
                acknowledgement), and reports can be made 24/7. <br><br>

                Pursuant to the Regulations, the Compliance Officer, director or employee of CryptoSafe, shall not
                disclose to customer
                the fact that a suspicious transaction or activity report or related information has been or is being
                submitted to the
                NCA or that a money laundering or terrorism financing investigation is being or has been carried out.
                This term does not
                preclude disclosure or communication between directors and employees of the company and advocates or
                competent
                authorities.<br><br>

                Employees are encouraged to seek the assistance of the Compliance Officer with any questions or concerns
                they may have
                with regard to CryptoSafe`s AML / CFT policies and procedures.

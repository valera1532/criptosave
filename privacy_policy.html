                <strong>DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES</strong>

                The GDPR, which was adopted in 2016 by all member of EU states to harmonize data privacy laws across
                Europe,
                sets up six
                enforceable principles of good practice. The UK has implemented the fundamental provisions of the
                Regulation
                (EU)
                2016/679 (GDPR) into its national law and requires all those who collect, process and control personal
                data
                of
                individuals to strictly comply with the law and implement all necessary mechanisms for its collection,
                protection and
                processing. <br><br>

                Therefore, data collector, data processor or data controller or any person who collects, process, holds
                or
                uses personal
                data must comply with the following requirements: -
                <ul>
                    <li>a) that processing be lawful and fair;</li>
                    <li>b) that purposes of processing be specified, explicit and legitimate;</li>
                    <li>c) that personal data be adequate, relevant and not excessive;</li>
                    <li>d) that personal data be accurate and kept up to date;</li>
                    <li>e) that personal data be kept for no longer than is necessary; and</li>
                    <li>f) that personal data be processed in a secure manner.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>



                These provide that personal data shall be:

                i. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness,
                fairness and
                transparency’); <br>

                ii. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that
                is
                incompatible
                with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
                historical research
                purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be
                incompatible with the
                initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);

                iii. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
                processed (‘data
                minimisation’);

                iv. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that
                personal data
                that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified
                without delay
                (‘accuracy’);

                v. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
                purposes for
                which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
                personal data will
                be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
                purposes or
                statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate
                technical
                and
                organisational measures required by the GDPR regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of
                the
                data
                subject (‘storage limitation’);

                vi. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection
                against
                unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using
                appropriate
                technical or
                organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).

                <strong>WHAT IS GDPR AND WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT</strong>


                GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individual`s personal data that
                they
                collect and
                process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines
                for
                breach.
                Beyond these facts it`s simply the right thing to do. At CryptoSafe we strongly believe that your data
                privacy is very
                essential, and we are already having solid security and privacy practices ion place that go beyond the
                requirements of
                this new regulation.

            <section><strong>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND DATA SECURITY</strong>


                As CryptoSafe also operates outside the UK and uses cloud services organisation-wide, your personal data
                collected by
                CryptoSafe may be processed or accessed in the country/region where you use our products and services or
                in
                other
                countries/regions where CryptoSafe have a presence. These jurisdictions may have different data
                protection
                laws. In such
                circumstances, CryptoSafe will take measures to ensure that data is processed as required by this Policy
                and
                the
                applicable national laws and regulations.

                We are committed to keeping personal information secure and we have implemented appropriate information
                security
                policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal information that we have under our
                control
                from
                unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification and unlawful destruction or
                accidental loss.

                The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best
                to
                protect your
                personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site, unless you are
                communicating with
                us through a secure channel provided by us. Once we have received your information, we will use strict
                procedures and
                security features in an effort to prevent unauthorised access.</section>

                <strong>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING</strong>


                CryptoSafe will process your personal information only when we have one of the following grounds:

                • on the basis of your consent, e.g. when you complete a form to register on our website;
                • where necessary to enter into a contract with you and perform our obligations under that contract;
                • where we have a legitimate interest, subject to such processing not overriding your own rights and
                freedoms;
                • where we have a legal obligation to collect your personal information or otherwise need your personal
                Information to
                protect your vital interests or those of another person; or
                • exceptionally, when necessary, in the public interest, for example when law enforcement agencies
                request
                information
                to investigate a crime.
